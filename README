ThreadPool Class

The ThreadPool class is a C++ class that provides a simple thread pool implementation. A thread pool is a group of worker threads that are created at initialization time and are used to execute a queue of tasks. This can help improve the performance of programs that need to perform many small, independent tasks, by minimizing the overhead associated with thread creation and destruction.
Usage

To use the ThreadPool class in your program, you first need to include the appropriate header file:

#include "thread_pool.hpp"

You can then create a ThreadPool object by specifying the number of threads to use:


ThreadPool pool(4); // create a thread pool with 4 worker threads

To add a task to the thread pool, you can use the enqueue() member function:

pool.enqueue([](){
    // code to execute in the worker thread
});

The argument to enqueue() is a callable object (e.g., a lambda function) that will be executed in one of the worker threads.
